This recipe is perfect for salmon fillet, even though it calls for salmon steaks.  I cut up the salmon into individual portions and followed the instructions exactly.  I'm on one of those food combining diets, so I left out the white wine but added just a dash of white wine vinegar instead (just a little bit, not enough to change the taste of the dish).  Super yummy, and leftovers for lunch today (lucky me)!\",\n",

I did add 3 cloves of garlic, and seasoned fresh bread crumbs with Smash Seasoning(318441).

I divide the dough in half, knead on floured surface a few times, and then stretch into a cirle. I like to bake in my cast-iron skillet- just brush pan with olive oil and sprinkle in a little corn meal.

The only difference being Marsala wine instead of dry red, chicken/turkey sausage, cutting the sausages and finishing cooking on top of the stove instead of the oven.   My family also traditionally serves sausage and peppers over polenta...this compared very well with my family recipe and is probably less calories and heats the kitchen up less in the summertime!',\n",

Also, once the strawberries cook down, I use a potato masher to break them up a bit more and I like that consistency.  The black pepper kick in this jam is really fun, and it's great on toasted English muffins, as well as on peanut butter & jelly sandwiches (made with whole wheat bread.)  I wish this was a canning recipe so I could make more at a time and store it on a shelf - we love it!\",\n",

I can\\'t resist a splash of hot sauce too! I \"bake\" my squash in the microwave for two 8 minute blasts so it is easy to peel when cool, then freeze the delicious flesh. Carrots don\\'t freeze very well so this soup is best eaten right up.',\n",

The adults and kids have gone crazy eating them.  And since they're so healthy I let them!  Thanks Barb for a recipe that's already become a family favorite!\",\n",
       " \"This was really good, though I made a few modifications for time (and laziness). I took semi frozen chicken breasts, browned them, then added the vinegar and chicken stock to cook them the rest of the way through at a simmer. I did omit the sugar to avoid the sugary-ness some reviewers commented on and it was PERFECT. As for the couscous I didn't really change anything, except I used cold broth and let it soak because I had the time to wait for the frozen chicken breasts to cook. I also added a little more margarine because I wanted a nice garlic-buttery flavor (and it certainly didn't disappoint). Served with recipe #289161. Thanks so much Miraklegirl!\",\n",

       " \"This was simply WONDERFUL! I didn't have any seasoned salt, so I omitted it. I made another substitution by necessity..didn't have any frozen hash browns, so I made some from fresh potatoes. About half way through the cooking I peeked in and saw that they were browning on the bottom but the potatoes weren't cooking. I needed to add water. DUH! I can't remember exactly how much I added, so I'll redo this review when I make it again. I'll also use less butter next time. These hash browns are to die for.... truly!\",\n",

       " \"I give this recipe a 3.5 stars.  It was okay and I would make it again.<br/><br/>I used drumsticks instead of wings because they were on sale at the grocery store.  I also used low sodium soy sauce.  I did forget to marinade the chicken.  I don't know how that affected the flavor.  I do wish the sauce was thicker.  I wanted it to be more like a barbecue sauce but it was move fluid.  Next time I will thicken it up with corn starch or flour.\",\n",

       " \"I'm sorry.  It wasn't our favorite by any stretch.  There is something missing that would turn this from okay to amazing.  The turmeric made it a strange orange color that was unappealing. The marinade smelled like carne asada and maybe that is what I was expecting.  I also cooked it on a grill pan and it smelled delightful while grilling but just didn't meet expectations when served.  I will keep watching because I think with a small tweak it could be really good.  I am just not sure what that tweak is.\",\n",

I used rosemary on 1/2 my chicken and basil on the other half.  I didn't think I liked rosemary very well before, but this was very good.  The rosemary was not overwhelming.

She told her mom this was even better than her mac &amp; cheese.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I made two minor substitutions.  I always use cornstarch rather than flour in my sauces (use half as much cornstarch as flour) and I substituted 1/3 cup butter plus 3/4 cup milk for each cup of cream.

The glaze is TDF good, a fudgy smooth consistency, and even DH who doesn\\'t like coconut thought the shredded coconut on top was perfect. So, for taste we all would agree on a definite 5 stars. :) My concern is that the recipe could benefit from some modifications & clarifications. The first thing I would want to point out is that the recipe as printed doesn\\'t make just \"large\" cupcakes. It will make JUMBO cupcakes. I don\\'t have a jumbo pan so I would have cut the recipe down had I known before hand. Instead I ended up making 36 regular sized cupcakes & because they had to be cooled in the pan before removing to wire rack (& because of the cakes\\' texture, this was in fact necessary) it took 3 hours just to bake all 36 cakes (2 days from start to finish). As far as the recipe, I think there is much too much butter. So much that the muffin tins felt as if I\\'d greased them before putting the paper liners in, but I didn\\'t. I also think the amount of sugar called for is overkill. They didn\\'t taste overly sweet, but the tops of the cakes are nearly caramelized. The butter sank to the bottom & made the cake greasy while the sugar floated to the top & turned into a sticky candy coating. Removing the cakes from the pan &/or removing the paper liners without tearing the entire top of the cake was a very slow & tedious process. I did enough to get a satisfactory photo but will just let everyone remove their own now. :) Again, this recipe is worth the effort in flavor & we would give 5 stars for that. Thanks for sharing, my3bb! Made for ZWT5-Ali Baba\\'s Babes.  UPDATE:  It\\'s been 4 days since I made these & they\\'ve been sitting out on the counter the whole time (not covered or sealed).  I just finished eating one & cannot believe that it\\'s still SO GOOD!  They\\'re not greasy anymore & still aren\\'t dried out.  The cake is still moist & only just approaching the \"day old\" stage around the top edge that isn\\'t in paper or covered in frosting.  The frosting is like biting into a rich, creamy fudge & was such a nice surprise.  I\\'m tempted to say that making these a day or two ahead of an event would be just perfect as far as their aging to perfection & the convenience of being able to make a baked good ahead.  :)',\n",

The first test batch was less than impressive, the wonton wrappers were a dry/crisp and dull, so after asking-used a very light brush of oil and a pinch of salt made them soft and inviting(can also use cooking oil spray). I found the spice level/combination very agreeable but felt it was repetitious(maybe because of the turkey being less powerful than beef) and in need something. I noticed other people use rasins or sultanas so I chopped some for a second test batch--yummy! They added a needed contrast for my liking and the taste was complete. I wanted to give 5 stars but I've never had Samosas before so I can't say how traditional these taste.\\r\\nAs far as quantity,I made 12-15 filled wonton wraps and filled a small burrito wrap for neighbor to munch on and still had about 3/4 of the mixture remaining (in the fridge for tommorow) so I'd say #60 individual peices easily.

Both are revisions I'd keep as the flavours of all the veg really came through and I suspect the onion might over power some of them. Left out the lemon as I didn't see where to add it. I was serving it with a harissa chicken &amp; chickpea recipe that provided a rich tomato sauce so omitted the tomatoes and chickpeas in this, which I'd do again too unless this was the main dish I think. To add a bit of moisture to it I drizzled a simple yogurt, lemon and tahini dressing over it.

You use one sleeve--that also was in the original--somehow changed.  I always thought boiling was only one temperature-you put it on high until it bubbles then you watch it so that it doesn't burn while it continues to bubble for three minutes as it thickens,turning down the heat slightly if necessary.  The mixture does thicken some, but it is not unmanageable.  This is the recipe that a caterer gave me 10 years ago and I have always had wonderful results following it exactly, as have the many people I've given it to.  I am sorry that it did not work out for you.\",\n",

We didn't put shrimp on ours (because we were grilling some other shrimp at the same time), but otherwisemade this according to the recipe.  We loved the rum soaked fruit, and those of us who are not Jerk freaks really liked the amount of seasoning on this.  The Jerk freaks in the family were upset because you could still taste the chicken and the beef through the Jerk! :)  So they gave it a 3.  This also made for really good tacos, just scoot everything into a tortilla.  I served this with Recipe #178567.  Devilishly Divine, indeed! :) Thank you.\",\n",

Both batches finally eventually started growing after I added a teaspoon of sugar.  I was even measuring the temperature of my water, and keeping my oven at the recommended (measured) ambient temperature (always taking my stuff out of the oven when turning the element on).  Is it possible to get an initial proof with just whole wheat flour in anything resembling a reasonable period of time?  I used King Arthur Flour Whole Wheat Flour (the one they had at my grocery store).  <br/><br/>After all that, I was afraid the dough would give me trouble rising, but it didn't.

I also garnished with some fresh basil, and some ancho chile powder, both flavors that really enhance the corn.  Although the recipe calls for straining the mixture before serving, I opted not to, and instead used a hand blender to puree it even more finely in the pan.  I like the texture this way, and so did DH.  He actually thought it should be a bit thicker, which I may accomplish next time by adding a little flour between steps one and two.  My only issue, and it's a minor one, was the balance of flavor between the corn and the onion.  I thought the onion was a little strong, so next time I think I'll either use a little less, or use a sweet onion instead of the plain yellow onion that I used this time.

Then, as I was watching the rising cycle, I became worried looking at the small lump of dough at the bottom of the pan instead of the plump loaf I was anticipating. Well...I shouldn't have had one worry, since the loaf did indeed rise nicely, the zucchini completely disappeared (except for the vitamins, of course) and the rosemary and sesame seeds provided a perfume to swoon over. This is a gentle, soft loaf that is delicious and easy to slice after cooling and that makes superb toast as well.

I think that is the neatest part of it! I had pancake syrup for a topping but most ate it plain (but this dish is anything but plain!) and sprinkled it liberally with powdered sugar. For ease of cutting I reccomend lining the two layers up together.

I always approach kugel recipes as fair game: an opportunity to vary what I throw in and what I omit according to the whim of the moment.  It was a while since I'd made kugel so I approached making this dish with considerable enthusiasm.  I made a few changes because of personal taste preferences and a few additions because I love the additional ingredients.  I omitted the hot pepper sauce and used only 1/2 teaspoon of worcestershire sauce (we have almost zero tolerance of anything hot and spicy), I doubled the garlic and I added an onion and one leek: just love the combination of onions, garlic and leek.  I also added a cup of thinly sliced mushrooms.  I added basil and oregano (as in the ingredients list) but also added rosemary, sage and thyme. I used low-fat cottage cheese and low-fat sour cream as I find that low-fat versions of these makes no appreciable difference to the final dish.  Once all the ingredients had been combined, I added two eggs - as eggs have featured in most other kugel recipes I've made.  I baked the kugel in several smaller dishes as two were destined for the freezer.  I look forward to making this again - probably quite differently next time.
